# Inspiration behind the App
## 1.) Alarming level of Air Pollution in India

- **Twenty-two of the world’s 30 cities** with the worst levels of air pollution are in India; **six Indian cities are in the top ten**. (IQAir AirVisual’s 2019 World Air Quality Report)
- At least **140 million people in India** breathe air that is **10 times** or more over the WHO safe limit of 60 for PM 2.5.(based on 2016 data)
- All of India’s 1.4 billion people **(100% of the country’s population)** are exposed to unhealthy levels of ambient PM 2.5 – the most harmful pollutant.
- **1.7 million deaths in India** were attributable to air pollution in 2019, which was **18%** of the total deaths in the country according to India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative, a scientific paper on the health and economic impact of air pollution published last December in Lancet Planetary Health.
- Deaths Tied to Air Pollution **Tripled** in The Past 20 Years in India.
- Air pollution is India’s **second-largest public health risk** after malnutrition
- Air pollution may reduce life expectancy of Indians by **nine years**.

## 2.) Lack of proper mitigation strategy and unified approach. Interference by different agencies such as Supreme Court of India, National Green Tribunal (NGT), Ministries.
- India's Air Pollution Mitigation Strategy lacks proper Direction. The American mathematician Edward Quade once said that “policy makers seem to fail more often because they solve the wrong problem than because they get the wrong solution to the right problem”. Quade’s observation holds true even today – more so in the context of India’s air pollution crisis, which suffers from a surplus of ‘solutions’ with very little understanding of the problem.
- Many times, the courts have had to intervene for the authorities to take action on air pollution.

## 3.) Failure of existing Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP): Non-availability of varied real time data from limited number of air pollution monitoring stations.
- In 2016, the Supreme Court approved the implementation of a Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) for Delhi and NCR. Pursuant to this, the government notified the GRAP to be implemented through the Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (EPCA). GRAP is basically a plan to be implemented when the air quality deteriorates.
- Under the National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP),There are 573 operating stations in only 240 cities/towns (out of 4000 cities in India) in 26 states (out of 28 states in India) and 5 Union Territories (out of 8 Union Territories in India) of the country.
- Let’s take case of Bihar. The state capital Patna and Muzaffarpur figured among the four most polluted cities in the country and among the 32 most polluted cities globally, according to the the ‘World Air Quality Report, 2020’. 
- Now according to National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP), there are only 2 Air quality monitoring stations in Bihar that too only in Patna.
